echo "✅ DOCKER HEALTH CHECK - FINAL FIX APPLIED"
echo "=========================================="

echo ""
echo "🔍 Root Cause Analysis:"
echo "======================"
echo "❌ Backend HTTP server (port 8080) was redirecting ALL requests to HTTPS"
echo "❌ Health check: GET http://localhost:8080/health → 301 redirect"
echo "❌ Docker expects 200 OK response, not 301 redirect"
echo "❌ Result: Container marked as (unhealthy)"

echo ""
echo "🔧 Solution Implemented:"
echo "======================="
echo "✅ Modified HTTP server to serve health endpoints directly"
echo "✅ GET /health → 200 OK 'OK' (no redirect)"
echo "✅ GET /ping → 200 OK 'pong' (no redirect)"
echo "✅ All other HTTP requests → 301 redirect to HTTPS (security maintained)"

echo ""
echo "📋 Code Changes Made:"
echo "==================="
echo "File: backend/cmd/server/main.go"
echo "- Created separate HTTP router for health endpoints"
echo "- Health endpoints served directly on HTTP port 8080"
echo "- Other routes still redirect to HTTPS for security"

echo ""
echo "🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS FOR YOUR UBUNTU SERVER:"
echo "==========================================="

echo ""
echo "1. Stop current containers:"
echo "   sudo docker-compose down"

echo ""
echo "2. Rebuild backend with the fix:"
echo "   sudo docker-compose build --no-cache backend"

echo ""
echo "3. Start backend container:"
echo "   sudo docker-compose up -d backend"

echo ""
echo "4. Wait 30 seconds for startup, then check:"
echo "   sleep 30"
echo "   sudo docker-compose ps backend"

echo ""
echo "5. Test health endpoints (should NOT redirect now):"
echo "   sudo docker-compose exec backend wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/health"
echo "   sudo docker-compose exec backend wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/ping"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Expected Results:"
echo "=================="
echo "✅ /health returns: OK"
echo "✅ /ping returns: pong" 
echo "✅ Backend status: (healthy)"
echo "✅ No more 301 redirects for health endpoints"

echo ""
echo "🔐 Security Note:"
echo "================"
echo "✅ Health endpoints only available on HTTP for Docker internal use"
echo "✅ All application traffic still redirects to HTTPS"
echo "✅ No security compromise - only health checks use HTTP"

echo ""
echo "🎉 This Should Resolve Your Docker Health Check Issue!"
echo ""
echo "Once the backend is healthy, the frontend container should"
echo "start successfully since it depends on backend health."
