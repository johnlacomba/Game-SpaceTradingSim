echo "‚úÖ DOCKER HEALTH CHECK - FINAL FIX SUMMARY"
echo "=========================================="

echo ""
echo "üîß Issues Fixed:"
echo "==============="
echo "1. ‚úÖ Health endpoint (/health) confirmed working and unprotected"
echo "2. ‚úÖ Added /ping endpoint for additional connectivity testing"  
echo "3. ‚úÖ Fixed CORS middleware order (was potentially interfering)"
echo "4. ‚úÖ Improved Docker health check command with better error handling"
echo "5. ‚úÖ Increased start_period to 30s (gives backend more time to start)"

echo ""
echo "üè• Health Endpoints Available:"
echo "=============================="
echo "GET /health ‚Üí Returns 'OK' (for Docker health checks)"
echo "GET /ping   ‚Üí Returns 'pong' (for basic connectivity)"
echo ""
echo "Both endpoints:"
echo "- ‚úÖ No authentication required"
echo "- ‚úÖ Available on HTTP port 8080"
echo "- ‚úÖ Return plain text responses"
echo "- ‚úÖ Include proper Content-Type headers"

echo ""
echo "üê≥ Docker Configuration:"
echo "======================="
echo "Health Check Command:"
echo "  wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health"
echo ""
echo "Timing:"
echo "  - Start Period: 30s (backend startup time)"
echo "  - Interval: 30s (check every 30 seconds)"
echo "  - Timeout: 10s (each check times out after 10s)"
echo "  - Retries: 5 (more forgiving for intermittent issues)"

echo "üöÄ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR UBUNTU SERVER:"
echo "=========================================="

echo ""
echo "Step 1: Stop existing containers"
echo "  sudo docker-compose down"

echo ""
echo "Step 2: Clean and rebuild"
echo "  sudo docker system prune -f"
echo "  sudo docker-compose build --no-cache"

echo ""
echo "Step 3: Start containers (watch for health status)"
echo "  sudo docker-compose up -d"
echo "  watch 'sudo docker-compose ps'"

echo ""
echo "Step 4: Monitor backend startup"
echo "  sudo docker-compose logs -f backend"

echo ""
echo "Step 5: Test health endpoints manually"
echo "  sudo docker-compose exec backend wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/health"
echo "  sudo docker-compose exec backend wget -qO- http://localhost:8080/ping"

echo ""
echo "üîç Expected Results:"
echo "=================="
echo "‚úÖ Backend container: (healthy) status"
echo "‚úÖ Frontend container: (healthy) status" 
echo "‚úÖ Health check logs show successful requests"
echo "‚úÖ /health returns: OK"
echo "‚úÖ /ping returns: pong"

echo ""
echo "ü©∫ If Still Having Issues:"
echo "========================="
echo "Check backend startup logs:"
echo "  sudo docker-compose logs backend | grep -E '(error|Error|ERROR|fail|Fail)'"
echo ""
echo "Test port binding:"
echo "  sudo docker-compose exec backend netstat -ln | grep 8080"
echo ""
echo "Debug health check step by step:"
echo "  sudo docker-compose exec backend sh -c 'wget --quiet --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:8080/health && echo SUCCESS || echo FAILED'"

echo ""
echo "üéØ This Should Fix Your Docker Health Check Issues!"
echo ""
echo "The backend now has proper health endpoints that work independently"
echo "of AWS Cognito authentication, so Docker health checks will pass"
echo "even before you deploy your Terraform infrastructure."
